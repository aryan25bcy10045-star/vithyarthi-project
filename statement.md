# 📝 Project Documentation: To-Do List CRUD Application (VITYARTHI PROJECT)

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The main challenge for individuals and students is effectively managing and tracking their **daily tasks, assignments, and commitments**. Without a centralized, easy-to-use system, tasks can be forgotten, priorities can become unclear, and productivity suffers. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a simple, local, and intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** application where users can quickly manage their personal to-do lists.

## 📈 Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a fully functional, stand-alone **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library.

* **In Scope:**
    * Implementing all four CRUD operations for managing tasks.
    * Providing a simple, responsive, and visually appealing GUI.
    * Handling basic user input validation (e.g., preventing empty tasks).
    * Displaying the task list with its ID and completion status.
    * (Optional Future Scope Addition: Implement data persistence to save and load tasks using JSON/a text file.)
* **Out of Scope (Current Version):**
    * Network functionality or multi-user support.
    * Database integration (e.g., SQL).
    * Advanced features like prioritization levels, due dates, or reminders.
