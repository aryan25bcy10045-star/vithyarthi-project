#  Project Title: To-Do List CRUD Application



##  Problem Statement

The main challenge for individuals and students is managing and tracking their daily tasks, assignments, and commitments. Without a centralized and easy-to-use system, tasks can be forgotten, priorities can become unclear, and productivity suffers. This project aims to address this issue by providing a simple, local, and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) application where users can quickly manage their personal to-do lists.



##  Scope of the Project

This project will create a fully functional stand-alone CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Python and the Tkinter library.

1- In Scope:
  
* Implementing all four CRUD operations for managing tasks.
* Providing a simple, responsive, and visually appealing GUI.
* Handling basic user input validation, such as preventing empty tasks.
* Displaying the task list with its ID and completion status.
* (Optional Future Scope Addition: Implement data persistence to save and load tasks using JSON or a text file.)
  
2- Out of Scope (Current Version):
  
* Network functionality or multi-user support.
* Database integration, such as SQL.
* Advanced features like prioritization levels, due dates, or reminders.




##  Target Users

The primary users of this To-Do List application are those who need a straightforward way to organize their daily activities.

* Students: For tracking assignments, project deadlines, and study goals.
* Individuals/Professionals: For managing personal chores, work tasks, or day-to-day commitments.
* Beginner Programmers: It serves as a practical example of building a GUI application using OOP and Tkinter.
